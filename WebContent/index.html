                        We are a research group led by Prof. Erik Andersen at Cornell University studying second-language learning in video games. We developed Crystallize to make second-language learning approachable and engaging. We plan to use the data we collect from the game to help us better understand language learning and better help you learn a second language.

                        <em>Gabriel Culbertson</em> is a second-year PhD student in Information Science at Cornell. He spent nearly two years in China during his undergraduate program at Purdue where he developed a passion for second-language learning. He hopes to share his love of language learning and games through Crystallize.

                        <em>Shiyu Wang</em> is a sophomore studying Computer Science at Cornell. He likes mathematics and programming, and especially enjoys developing cool games. He's worked on nearly all of the core systems that make Crystallize what it is, including content creation tools, data structures and networking.

                        <em>Prof. Erik Andersen</em> is the primary faculty advisor for the <em>Crystallize</em> project. He has studied Japanese for seven years and still cannot speak it very well. This motivated him to investigate new methods of language instruction that can be dramatically more engaging and effective. He led the team that created Refraction (Center for Game Science 2010), a video game for learning fractions that has been played one million times and won the Grand Prize in the Disney Learning Challenge at SIGGRAPH 2010 and the Best Work in the Primary School Category in the 2011 NHK Japan Prize.
